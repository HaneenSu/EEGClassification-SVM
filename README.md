# EEGClassification-SVM
Classification of EEG trials and identifying important electrodes.

I used EEG dataset generated at AIM lab at NYUAD. The dataset was collected in an experiment that aimed to understand the neural activation of tactile feedback generated by a touch screen device. The experimental setup consisted of a surface-haptics device. Participants had to swipe on the screen under two experimental conditions: with and without tactile feedback. Conditions were randomized. PSD was extracted for each trial (theta,alpha,beta, gamma). We use SVM to identify the most influential electrodes in diffrentiating the two catgories.

I worked on this project with Chaitali Pawar.
